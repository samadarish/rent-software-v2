Payment proof upload debug steps
================================

1) Confirm scopes and deploy
- Open your Apps Script project and check appsscript.json includes both drive.file and drive scopes.
- Deploy a new version of the web app after authorizing the new scopes.
- Access the deployed URL once while signed in as the deployer to accept the Drive permission prompt.

2) Verify the "Payment Proofs" folder
- In Google Drive, search for a folder named "Payment Proofs" created by the script.
- Ensure the deployer owns the folder and that files can be created inside it.

3) Capture a fresh attachment
- In the UI, select a small image (<2 MB) when recording a payment.
- Submit the payment and confirm a new file appears in the "Payment Proofs" folder with the expected timestamped name.

4) Inspect script logs if nothing is saved
- In Apps Script, open Executions -> View Logs for the savePayment call.
- Look for "Attachment save failed" entries; if present, reauthorize the deployment and retry.

5) Check payload format
- Use browser dev tools Network tab to ensure the POST body contains attachmentDataUrl with a "data:image/...;base64," prefix.
- If not present, reselect the image in the modal and try again.
