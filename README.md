# Tauri + Vanilla

This template should help get you started developing with Tauri in vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Run the app
1. Install dependencies once with `npm install`.
2. Launch the desktop shell with `npm run tauri dev` (requires Rust and the Tauri CLI; see the testing guide for details).

## Testing and QA
Follow the manual QA steps in [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) to exercise the View Tenants directory (filters, search, modal editing) and confirm the backend integration works end-to-end.
